            <hr>
            <p>I am Aibiike Omurzakova, a dedicated Computer Programming and Analysis student at St. Lawrence College with a strong academic record. My journey in technology is marked by a deep-seated passion for coding and a robust understanding of web development fundamentals.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My practical experience includes a placement as a Full Stack Developer at the Ministry of Health, where I have been actively involved in developing web applications using Java, Angular, and Spring Boot. This role has not only sharpened my technical skills but also enhanced my ability to work collaboratively in dynamic team environments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to my professional engagements, I've taken on roles that demonstrate my commitment to learning and community involvement, such as being a Peer Tutor at my college and volunteering as an English teacher. I am currently a mentor for the Technovation Girls program, where I guide and inspire young women in technology and entrepreneurship. This experience allows me to share my passion for technology and contribute to the nurturing of future tech leaders.</p>
